<font size="4">Aim of the project was to analyse and annotate texts focusing on the artworks Macbeth (drama and opera), West Side Story and different representations of them with specific vocabulary, in order to extract a knowledge graph using tools and programms such as Pyrml and Protégé for further integrations and refinement. The whole process that lead us to the project final result was then described step by step in the present website. Project, data and further documentation were eventually uploaded on a GitHub repository.</font>

		<font size="4"> The text “aw_performing_history_macbeth_shakespeare” is written in English language and describes the the play “Macbeth” performed in different years. The text talks about the history of play, actors who played the main roles there, countries and theatres where it was performed.“Macbeth” was tagged as “dul:InformationObject”, but in some situations Macbeth is the main character of the play, in such case the tag “foaf:Person” was used.The text talks about different centuries when the play was performed, that is why the class “tiapit:TimeInterval” was used very often. In the sentences like “Samuel Pepys saw the play on 5 November 1664” to relate the play with the date, the property “tiapit:atTime” was used.  Different historical figures (<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Forman">Simon Forman</a>) who recorded the play, actors (<a href= "https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Garrick">David Garrick</a>, <a href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/ru/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/john-philip-kemble">John Philip Kemble</a>, <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095823129?rskey=QU7Xs0&result=14">Johann Friedrich Ferdinand Fleck</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Irving">Sir Henry Irving</a>) who played the main parts in the performance , diarists (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>) were also mentioned in the text. Most often they were annotated as “foaf:Person”. For those sentences like “Sarah Siddons plays Lady Macbeth” the property “core:hasRole” was used. For those annotations like “Shakespeare” and “Macbeth” or “play” the relation “a-cd:has Author” was used.
		The text also talks about some historical events as, for example, <a href="https://shakespeareandbeyond.folger.edu/2017/05/09/astor-place-riot-macbeth-new-york/">Astor Place riot</a>, which got the class “core:Event”. Some specific cultural events got the tag “cis:CulturalEvent”. To connect the event with a specific place and a specific time the properties “event:place” and “ event:time” were used.
		The text also touches upon countries and cities where the play was performed. Such places were tagged as “l0:Location” and the property to connect them is “core:hasLocation”.
		Different famous theatres as Broadway theatre got the tag “arco:TangibleCulturalProperty” as they represent immovable tangible cultural property.

		<font size="4"> The text “a_opere_shakespeare_film_IT” is written in Italian and it is an overview on films and animated films that have taken inspiration from Shakespeare’s plays. Among the most renowned films, there are: West Side Story, Shakespear in Love, Il Re Leone (The Lion King) and 10 cose che odio di te (10 Things I Hate About You), respectively inspired by Romeo and Juliet, The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark and The Taming of the Shrew.
		Each time in the text there has been a reference to “play” “tragedy” “comedy” all those elements have been annotated with “dul:InformationObject” because by being such a general class it proved to be the most suitable one for such entities. This class has been used also to annotate plays, films and song titles.
		Moreover, this text doesn’t mention any specific performance of the mentioned plays or films, therefore the tag “dul:InformationRealization” couldn’t be used.
		Speaking about the actors and the character they played, actors were tagged using “l0:Agent” and the character they played was tagged as “roapit:Role”. Consequently, the relation between the two tags is “core:hasRole”. This property relates an agent that holds a role in a situation to that role. The first tag was used for people who have concretely realized or had an active role. Same goes for directors, producers, and composers. They have all been tagged with “l0:Agent”, but the relations usually linked to these entities was property “a-cd:has Author”, as they were usually connected to titles and they were the one who produced or create that particular movie/play/soundtrack. 
		When referring to dates, the triplet usually was “dul:InformationObject” - “tiapit:atTime” - “tiapit:TimeInterval”, where usually a title of a play/film was linked with the year in which it was created or broadcasted through the property that states the relation between anything and a time interval.
		Finally, when referring to specific Film Festivals those were annotated using the class “cis:CulturalEvent” which represents an event that typically is related to the cultural domain, and it is also more accurate than using the more generic class “core:Event”. This class was linked to the class “arco:TangibleCulturalProperty” which represents a tangible cultural property, either immovable or movable, through the property “arco:involvesCulturalProperty”, which relates a cultural entity to a cultural property.

    <font size="4">The text “aw_macbeth_shakespeare_IT is written in Italian and gives a general overview on Shakespeare’s tragedy <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Macbeth-by-Shakespeare">"Macbeth"</a>, starting from an introduction of the main themes and its structure. Considering the fact that the main part of the text is made up by the plot of the play and that therefore many characters are mentioned, the most frequently used tag was foaf:Person, followed by the tag dul:InformationObject, which was mostly used when referring to intangible things (that often had to do with culture and intangible pieces of art, the most obvious example is “The tragedy of Macbeth”, referring to the play) because by being such a general class it proved to be the most suitable one for such entities. On the other hand, the tag dul:InformationRealization, which is closely related to dul:InformationObject as it refers to a particular version or realization of the original object, was used with lower frequency (for instance in the case of “versione operistica”, which clearly refers to the tragedy of Macbeth played in the form of an opera). Apart from the case of “versione operistica” where the relation used is a-cd:hasAuthor because it’s connected with <a href= "https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-verdi">Verdi</a>, dul:InformationObject and dul:InformationRealization have been connected through the property a-cd:isInspiredBy, which brings us to the tag dc:BibliographicResource, also used very little, for instance with <a href= " https://www.britannica.com/topic/First-Folio">“Folio”</a>, which is the original document where the tragedy was first published in 1623. This entity were connected with the property dc:date and “1623” was tagged as tiapit:TimeInterval, as it refers to a general time frame that takes up the whole year of 1623 and not a specific point in time.
 As mentioned above the tag foaf:Person was used for the characters of the play, this tag was often followed by another one, roapit:Role, in fact after the mention of the characters a little description was used to identify them better, (for example “Lady Macbeth, la moglie di Macbeth”; “Malcolm, il figlio di Duncan” where Lady Macbeth and Malcolm were tagged as foaf:Person and moglie di Macbeth and figlio di Duncan as roapit:Role, therefore connected with the relation core:hasRole). Similarly to foaf:Person, the tag foaf:Agent was also used for people mentioned in the text, however the difference of these two tags lies in the fact that foaf:Agent was used for people who have concretely realized or had an active role in some actions (for example Shakespeare is tagged as foaf:Agent as he is the one who actually wrote the tragedy of Macbeth, Verdi is also tagged as foaf:Agent because he is the one who composed the operatic version of the tragedy, as a matter of fact in such cases the relation used was a-cd:hasAuthor).
The other two tags to be found in the annotation are core:event, to tag events or general situations such as “invasione di Scozia” or “battaglia”, they are connected with their respective entity through the properties event:agent to those leading the invasion and core:hasLocation to the entity “sotto le mura di <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/place/Dunsinane-mountain-Scotland">Dunsinane”</a>, which brings us to the tag l0:Location, used for anything that identifies a physical place.

 <font size="4">a_west_side_story_review text is the review of the 1961 film produced by <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Wise">Robert Wise</a> and made out of the <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Broadway-street-and-district-New-York-City">Broadway</a> musical West Side Story, inspired by Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet. The review mentions all the people and different aspects involved in the realization of the film. 
dul:InformationObject is the mostly used class, as a matter of fact for entities such as music, choreography, lyrics, screenplay etc that are very different from one another but still have in common the fact that together they are all components that make up the film, it was necessary to find a suitable class that was general enough to group all of the different areas and aspects involved in the making of the movie. Dul:InformationObject was also used for general terms like “musical numbers”, “film” , connected with the relation ds:hasTitle to the titles of the main songs performed during the musical, also identified with the tag dul:InformationObject (for instance “America” and “Something comin’”). The songs were in turn connected through the property a-cd:has Author to the performers, actors and singers tagged as foaf:Person, the second most frequent class used in the annotations. The actors are then often followed by the character they play, (example: “<a href= "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Natalie-Wood">Natalie Wood</a>, the Puerto Rican”; “<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Chakiris">George Chakiris</a>, leader of the Puerto Rican gang” etc, where the description of the character is tagged as roapit:Role and the relation between the two classes is as a consequence core:hasRole). 
The tag l0:Agent was also often used, this one in particular was used when the name of a person was connected with their work and with what they have contributed to the film, as in this case for example: “Johnny Green conducts editing”, “Saul Bass is responsible for novel presentation of titles and credits” where Johnny Green and Saul Bass are tagged as l0:Agent, editing and novel presentation of titles and credits are tagged as dul:InformationObject and their relation is a-cd:hasAuthor. However, when a person was classified with their profession, such as in “Boris Leven scores as production designer” for Boris Leven the tag foaf:Person was used which was then connected through the property core:hasRole to production designer, tagged with the class roapit:Role.
Dc:BibliographicResource was used only once, specifically for the word “book” in the sentence “<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a>’s screenplay, based upon <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Laurents">Arthur Laurents</a>’ solid and compelling book…” where screenplay is connected to book through the property a-cd:isInspiredBy.

<font size="4">The text “aw_distribuzione_produzione_west_side_story_IT” concerns the production, staging and distribution of the musical <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/West-Side-Story">West Side Story</a>, annotated as “dul:InformationObject”. As the text focused on the realization of the musical, the class “dul:InformationRealization” was often used in reference to musical staging, debuts, revivals and performances, as well as the classes concerning time and location, namely “tiapit:TimeInterval” and “l0:Location”, and their respective properties. Festivals and tours are also often mentioned in this context, and they have been marked as “cis:CulturalEvent”. 
Within the text people are frequently mentioned, such as actors, directors, producers, choreographers etc., as well as their roles or tasks in the production/staging of the musical. These figures have been tagged using the class “foaf:Person”, when the person in question was an actor, or using “l0:Agent”, when rereferring to agentive figures, such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jerome-Robbins">Jerome Robbins</a> or <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/robert-e-griffith/g1211pr5g?categoryid=historical-figure">Robert E. Griffith</a>. During the annotation process we also decided to create a new class, “Actor” (subclass of “foaf:Person”), in order to group this category of people under a more specific tag, and it has been used to annotate figures as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/07/obituaries/larry-kert-60-a-romantic-lead-in-the-original-west-side-story.html">Larry Kert</a> or <a href="https://masterworksbroadway.com/artist/carol-lawrence/">Carol Lawrence</a>. 
The biggest obstacle during the annotation process was avoiding repetitions, especially when it came to the lists of roles, in view of the creation of the knowledge graph. 
It is also pivotal to mention the class “arco:TangibleCulturalProperty”, which has mainly been used in relation to theaters, such as the <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/her-majestys/about-her-majestys-theatre/">Her Majesty Theatre</a> of London. While working on Recogito, prizes and awards have also been noted under this class, but they have been later marked as “Prize” on Protégé. In this respect the creation of a new property seemed necessary. For this reason the property “arco:involvesCulturalProperty” (when linked to an award) was then replaced by “AwardedTo”.

<font size="4">The text “aw_macbeth_shakespeare_EN” is an introductive description of the play <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Macbeth-by-Shakespeare">The Tragedy of Macbeth</a> written by William Shakespeare. For what concerns the annotations process, the artwork (namely Macbeth) was annotated as “dul:InformationObject”, which is the most frequently used tag within the text. William Shakespeare, English playwright, poet, and author of the tragedy in question, was annotated as “l0:Agent” and related to its creations, such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hamlet-by-Shakespeare">Hamlet</a>, <a href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-plays/othello-moor-venice/">Othello</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear">King Lear</a>,  with the property “a-cd:hasAuthor”. In the text, people as well as characters, who played a significant role for the tragedy, are often mentioned; for this reason the classes “foaf:Person” (Macduff, Duncan, Lady Macbeth and James I) and “roapit:Role” (King of Scotland)  were frequently used, as well as the properties “core:hasRole” and “a-cd:isInspiredBy” in relation to them. 
During the creation the process of annotation and transformation of texts into knowledge graphs we decided to expand the vocabulary by creating new classes and properties, including the class “Title”, which has been used in this text to annotate two instances: “The Scottish Play” and “The Tragedy of Macbeth”.
The text also explains how the tragedy was mainly inspired by two elements: the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/holinsheds-chronicles-1577">Holinshed’s Chronicles</a> and the execution of Henry Garnet. The first one has been annotated as “dc:BibliographicResource”, since the Chronicles were the primary source for the author when writing the play, while, as regards the execution of Henry Garnet the class used was “core:Event”, which has also been used with reference to the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/gunpowder-plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>. 
During the annotation process the class “arco:TangibleCulturalProperty” has also been used a few times with reference to the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/shakespeares-first-folio">Folio</a>, concrete realization of Shakespeare’s artwork.

	<ul>
		<font size="4">After creating the annotations in Recogito the next step was the transformation of the annotations into a knowledge graph using the automatic transformation online tool Pyrml. 
		Unfortunately, the transformation could not have been done successfully during the first attempts. 
		Due to the fact that several mistakes were made while working on the texts and choosing the wrong settings at the very beginning, the online tool Pyrml threw an error message. 
		After a careful examination of the files and errors` correction (like a double tag on one word) the annotations were uploaded into Pyrml and the right ttl format file could have been downloaded.

<LEFT><h2 style="color:#7b0000;"><A NAME="Terzo"></A>Elaboration in Protégé</h2></LEFT>
	<ul>
		<font size="4">The following step was to upload the ttl file into Protégé. After doing that, as now all the classes and connections could be easily seen,  several small errors in annotations have been found and eliminated. That was done without any problems, but several obstacles occurred during the elaboration of the file into the knowledge graph. 
While working with classes in Recogito, we have realised that we need more detailed vocabulary in order to specify several groups of words. For that purpose, several new classes and subclasses were created. Thus, “Cultural Event” has become a subclass of an “Event”, as it specifies an event having a cultural theme, a new subclass of “InformationRealization” was created that got a name “PerformanceProperty” which describes all the different aspects involved in the realization of a performance, such as choreography, music score, screenplay, editing etc.). For all these terms the tag “InformationObject” was first used, but we realized all these words shared the same context, for this reason they needed to be grouped under a suitable class. A new subclass of “TangibleCulturalProperty” was made and was named “Prize”, along with this new subclass it was necessary, in order to have a proper relation, to create also a new property, that is “awarded to”. 
Since all the texts contained many different actors, the new subclass of “Person”, ”Actor”, was created in order to separate this category of people from diarists and directors who were not mentioned so often. 
Also, since the titles of several different plays, songs, musicals and other artworks were mentioned in our texts  the new tag “Title” was implemented. In some cases this was necessary in order to eliminate the confusion that could come out between the name of the play and the main character, as for example, Macbeth indicates the name of the play, but also the name of the main character. 
The new vocabulary mentioned above has been created using the new ontology extension. This new file was then merged with all of our files separately. At this point each of us refined the annotations made and created knowledge graphs. In this respect, as our texts were so dense with information, we have decided to present separate graphs as they are more redable.

The first part is about the annotations on Recogito, where we wrote a paragraph for each text we worked on, here we added also the links to our Recogito pages, links to important characters, artworks etc mentioned in the texts, but also pictures which connect to our topics. The next sections describe the transformation through Pyrml and the part of the project that required us working on Protégé, to refine what we already did on Recogito and add new necessary classes and properties, with the final result of a knowledge graph, saved both as a graph and as a jpg file.</font>
